# Summer_Trip_Site
This is a website highlighting a road trip that was taken by my family in the summer of 2017. It was originally created as part of Udacity's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree course. I have subsequently edited it further to include, among other things, utilization of Bootstrap 4 (beta).
